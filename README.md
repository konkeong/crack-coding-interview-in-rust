The idea is to have lookup and construct the path of the letters.

Started off with draft code in Python. Took about 1 hour for 3 Python scripts.

Then translate to Rust, in 3 hours. Not that familiar with Rust syntax. Took the "blind alley" of using "iter()", "map()", "filter()". Did not understand the borrowing, when passing so many level deep. Ends up just flat/standard for-each loop.
